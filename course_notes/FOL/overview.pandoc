# First-Order Logic

## Overview

_Socrates is a human. All humans are mortal. Therefore, Socrates is mortal._

Converting this argument into PL would give us:
				<p> &emsp P, Q; therefore R.</p>
								Which is not a valid argumentâ€¦

	But when we look at this argument, it ought to be valid as the conclusion __follows__ from the premises.
  
  Just like _If both 2+2=4 and 1<2, then 1+1<4__ ought to be valid as it holds mathematically. 
  
  How are we going to determine if an arithmetic statement is valid or not if we cannot adequately express arithmetic in our logical system???
  
  Well, it turns out the PL is not _expressible_ enough to handle __all__, __exists__, or __predicates__.
	So we are going to extend PL to what is called First-Order Logic (FOL).

Comparing PL with FOL

__Propositional Logic__                             __First-Order Logic__                         
                                                
-Whole statements are abstracted as propositions.   -Statements are abstracted as subjects and verbs
-Cannot identify same object by a different name.   -Equality is introduced.
-Cannot distinguish between general and             -Statements may be quantified over all or 
specific statements.                                some subjects in the domain.

This kind of language problem in logic can also motivate tensed logic (reasoning about the past/future), 
modal logic (reasoning about what is possible/necessary). Such variants of logic are often objects of 
study in linguistics/philosophy/mathematics/CS.
