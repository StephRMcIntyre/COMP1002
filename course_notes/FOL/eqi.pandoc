# First-Order Logic

## Equality Introduction

a=a asserts that object a is equal to itself.

In FOL, we can get the statement that constant t is equal to constant t (written as t=t), for any constant, for free!
<br>A statement that can be written from nothing is considered to be an __axiom__.

To denote Equality Introduction in Carnap, we would write the justification `:=I`. 
<br>There are no lines to cite as this is an axiom.

Exercise: Finish the proof below.
