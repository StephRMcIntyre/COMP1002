# First-Order Logic

## Databases
# Relational Databases: 
# In databases, a relation is a “table” with rows and columns. Columns are called attributes. Rows are instances of the relation.
# Typically each table has a primary key. This key uniquely identifies the row.
# For example, Instructor Relation may have the primary key be Employee Number
