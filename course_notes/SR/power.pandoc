# Sets & Relations

## Sets

### Power Set

The __power set__ of set A, denoted as 𝒫(A), is the set of all subsets of A.
<br>This includes both A and ∅.

Examples:

+ 𝒫({1,2}) = {∅, {1}, {2}, {1,2}}	
<br>_Note: {1}≠1. Be careful when type-checking!_
+ 𝒫(∅) = {∅}
+ 𝒫({∅}) = {∅, {∅}}.

Note: ∅≠{∅}. 
<br>One is the empty set and the other is the set containing the empty set.
<br> $~~~~$ _Think about the empty set being nothing, and sets being a bag._
<br> $~~~~$ _This means ∅ is nothingness but {∅} is an empty bag._

1. 𝒫({(1,2)}) =

| {∅, {1,2}}
| *{∅, {(1,2)}}
| {∅, (1,2)}
```

2. 𝒫({∅, {∅}}) =

```

#### Proving Properties

__Example__
<br>For any sets A,B, prove that the following property holds: A ⊆ B ⇒ 𝒫(A) ⊆ 𝒫(B).
<br>Proof: Suppose that A ⊆ B.
<br>Let C∈𝒫(A) where C is arbitrary.
<br> _Remember, the 𝒫(A) is a set of sets, so C must be a set._
<br>By definition of power set, C ⊆ A.
<br>It follows that C ⊆ B by transitivity of subsets (see Subsets page).
<br>Since C ⊆ B, C∈𝒫(B) by definition of power set.
<br>Since C was an arbitrary element of 𝒫(A), and we found that C∈𝒫(B), we know that 𝒫(A) ⊆ 𝒫(B).
<br>Therefore for any sets A,B, A ⊆ B ⇒ 𝒫(A) ⊆ 𝒫(B).

Exercise: For any sets A,B prove that the following property holds: A ⊂ B  ⇒  𝒫(A) ⊂ 𝒫(B).

Exercise: For any sets A,B prove that the following property holds: 𝒫(A) ⊆ 𝒫(B) ⇒ A ⊆ B.
