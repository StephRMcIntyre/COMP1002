# Sets and Relations

##Power set

The power set of a set A, denoted as P(A), is the set of all subsets of A.<br>
This includes both A and ∅.<br>
Remember, ∅ and {} mean the same thing.

In fact, the number of elements in P(A) is $2^{# of elements in A}$.

Examples:

1.	P({1,2})  =  {∅, {1}, {2}, {1,2}} 
	<br> Note: {1}≠1. 
	<br>Be careful when type-checking!

2.	P({1,2,3})  =  {∅, {1}, {2},{3},{1,2},{1,3},{2,3},{1,2,3}} 

2.	P(∅) = {∅}

3.	P({∅}) = {∅, {∅}}.<br>
	Note: ∅ ≠ {∅}.
	<br>Why? Well, ∅∈{∅}, but ∅∉∅  (since there are no elements of the empty set!)

4.	P({1,2,{2,4}}) = ?

	Hint
	<details>


    	Set B = {2,4}, now do the power set!
	
	Solution
	<details>

    	P({1,2,B}) = {∅, {1}, {2},{B},{1,2},{1,B},{2,B},{1,2,B}} 
	Now, re-write the final solution, but substitute B for {2,4}.<br>
	P({1,2,{2,4}}) = {∅, {1}, {2},{{2,4}},{1,2},{1,{2,4}},{2,{2,4}},{1,2,{2,4}}}

Claim: For any sets A,B, prove that the following property holds: A ⊆ B ⇒ 𝒫(A) ⊆ 𝒫(B).
<br>Proof: Suppose that A ⊆ B.
<br>Let C∈𝒫(A) where C is arbitrary.
<br> _Remember, the 𝒫(A) is a set of sets, so C must be a set._
<br>By definition of power set, C ⊆ A.
<br>It follows that C ⊆ B by transitivity of subsets (see Subsets page).
<br>Since C ⊆ B, C∈𝒫(B) by definition of power set.
<br>Since C was an arbitrary element of 𝒫(A), and we found that C∈𝒫(B), we know that 𝒫(A) ⊆ 𝒫(B).
<br>Therefore for any sets A,B, A ⊆ B ⇒ 𝒫(A) ⊆ 𝒫(B).
