# Sets & Relations

## Sets

### Cardinality of Finite Sets

The size of a finite set A, denoted as |A|, is the number of distinct elements in A.
<br>The size of a set is often referred to as its __cardinality__. 

A set is __finite__ if there is a specific number k∈ℕ of elements.
<br>A set is __infinite__ if there is not a specific number of elements.

Examples: 	
<br>∅ is a finite set. |∅|=0.
<br>{1,2,3,4} is a finite set. |{1,2,3,4}|=4.
<br>ℕ is an infinite set.
<br>ℤ is an infinite set. _with the same cardinality as ℕ._
<br>ℝ is an infinite set _with a cardinality larger than ℕ._ [^1]

1. |{(1,2),3}| =
| 1
| *2
| 3
| 4
```

[^1]: We won't get into the differences between countably infinite and uncountably infinite, or comparing cardinalities of infinite sets. 
If you are interested in this, then I highly recommend taking the Discrete Mathematics course from the Mathematics Department or I can point you to some books if you would like.

The size of the __power set__ of a finite set A is $2^{|A|}$. 
<br> Example: |𝒫({1,2,3})| = $2^{|\{1,2,3\}}|$ = $2^3$ = 8.

2. |𝒫({(1,2),3})| =
| 2
| *4
| 6
| 8
```

##### Multiplicative Counting

For any two finite sets: |A×B| = |A| ⋅ |B|.

Example: 
<br>|{1,2,3}×{4,5}| = |{(1,4),(1,5),(2,4),(2,5),(3,4),(3,5)}| = 6
<br>Alternatively, |{1,2,3}×{4,5}| = |{1,2,3}| ⋅ |{4,5}| = 3 ⋅ 2 = 6


```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice options="check" submission="none" content-format="html"}
3. Let A = {1,2}. |A×A| = 
| 2
| 3
| *4
| 6
```

#### Additive Counting

Two sets A,B are called ‘disjoint’ when A⋂B=∅. 
<br>We think of this as having no elements in common.

For any two disjoint sets A,B: |A∪B| = |A| + |B|

Example: 
<br>|{1,2,3}∪{4,5}| = |{1,2,3,4,5}| = 5. 
<br>Alternatively, as {1,2,3}⋂{4,5}=∅, then
<br>|{1,2,3}×{4,5}| = |{1,2,3}| + |{4,5}| = 3 + 2 = 5

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice options="check" submission="none" content-format="html"}
4. Let A = {1,2}. Let B = {(1,2)}. |A∪B| = 
| 2
| *3
| 4
| 6
```

#### Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion

The counting of unions can be generalized to
<br>for any sets A,B, |A∪B| = (|A| + |B|) − |A⋂B|.

Example: |A∪B| = 4, |A⋂B| = 3, |B| = 4. What is |A|?
<br>As |A∪B| = (|A| + |B|) − |A⋂B|, we can rearrange and solve for |A|.
<br>|A| = (|A∪B| + |A⋂B|) - |B|
<br> $~~~~~$ = (4 + 3) - 4
<br> $~~~~~$ = 3.

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice options="check" submission="none" content-format="html"}
5. Let |A| = 5. Let |B| = 4. Let |A∪B| = 8. |A⋂B| = ?
| 0
| *1
| 2
| 3
```

Exercise: Use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to show that 
<br>For any sets A,B,C, |(A∪B)∪C| = |A| + |B| + |C| − |A⋂B| - |(A⋂C)| - |(B⋂C)| + |A⋂B⋂C|.
