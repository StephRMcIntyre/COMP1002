# Induction

## Mathematical Induction (aka Weak Induction)

<br><br>

###Towers of Hanoi

There are 3 pegs, n disks of different sizes.
<br>You can move any single disk on the top of one of the pegs to any other peg with no disk.  

__Claim:__ n disks takes at least $2^n-1$ moves.

__Property P(n):__ n disks takes at least $2^n-1$ moves.

__Base Case (n=1): 1 disk clearly takes $1=2-1=2^1-1$ moves.__

__Inductive Hypothesis:__ Suppose it takes at least $2^k -1$ moves to move k disks for some kâ‰¥1.

__Inductive argument:__ In order to move k+1 disks, the base disk must be moved.
<br>In order to do this, one peg must be empty and the base disk must be on top.
<br>Thus the top k disks must have moved to the third peg, taking at least $2^k-1$ moves.
<br>Then the base disk must move, and then the remaining k disks must be moved on top
of the base disk again. 
<br>All together, there must be at least $2^k-1+1+2^k-1 = 2^{k+1}-1$ moves.

By the principle of induction, n disks takes at least $2^n-1$ moves.

Combined with the previous result in the [overview](https://carnap.io/shared/smcintyre/book-induction-overview.pandoc), we find that the optimal number of moves for n
disks is always exactly $2^n-1$ moves.
