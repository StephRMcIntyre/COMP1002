# Solutions to practise problems.

Ex1:

1) __State the property__ you wish to prove. This is often expressed as a predicate.
<br>Let the Property P(n) be $n < n^2$.

2) __Base Case (BC, n=2):__ WTS P(2), as 2 is the smallest value as expressed in the problem statement.
<br>LHS = 2
<br>RHS = $2^2 = 4$
<br>As $2 < 4$, then LHS < RHS.
<br>Therefore $n < n^2$ holds for when $n=2$, and thus P(2) holds as desired.

3) __Inductive Step (IS):__
